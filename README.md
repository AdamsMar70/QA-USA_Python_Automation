Constants are written in uppercase
Comments are used to explain important blocks of code
Code is organized in a modular manner, with reuseable code blocks imported where necessary
No unnecessary wait functions that make the test run longer than it should 
Following a naming convention for test titles that start with test_ and provides a clear description of the test scenario. We provide test titles in the brief.
